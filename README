Translates languages from the command line.

It calls "urlencode," which is a php script, so throw that in a directory in your $PATH like /usr/bin

It needs that to create the URL to pass to curl.

Google charges for this API (i think), so I made a poor man's api.  

Do whatever you want with this.  Have fun.  Install all the character sets for your terminal for more functionality.

credits to fred dinkler on the urlencode mini-script, pretty useful, it turns out.
